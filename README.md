#### What is Arrow Dash?
        This program is a game in which arrows randomly fall from the top of the screen in lanes and the player has to press the 
        arrows as they fall at the correct timing. The game prompts the player with a start screen explaining the rules. 
        The player earns points for each arrow they correctly press the button for at the right time and the game ends when an arrow gets by.
        There are unique screens depending on how the player loses. The game uses lots of bright and vibrant colors to give it an exciting and eye pleasent look.
